# Cars Consumption Optimization

## Problem Description
Today, we want to optimize the consumption of cars by keeping a pleasant driving experience.  

## Solution Approach
We propose an AI solution to analyze a driving scenarios. The AI will learn to optimize the speed, acceleration, and braking to achieve the best fuel efficiency.

We want to make an environment that simulates different driving scenarios, city, highway, elevation difference, traffic conditions, weather conditions.

## Needs for the environment

- Physical model: speed, acceleration, torque, fuel consumption

- External factors: road type, weather conditions, elevation changes, traffic conditions

- Mechanical constraints: engine limits, braking, inertia

- Internal factors: driver behavior, current speed, real-time fuel consumption

- Actions: adjust fuel injection, modify air-fuel ratio, optimize engine timing, provide driver guidance


## Needs data
- Drivers profile
- motor curve
- consumption by diet

We need to collect real data or simulate the data.
